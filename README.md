Tracking Covid-19 in the United States.

## Motivation

It is a scary time right now, and as the saying goes, *knowledge is power*. I built this interactive map and series of charts to track the daily growth rate of coronavirus cases in the United States. Using Leaflet.js, chart.JS as well as the [Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/api) API. Users are able to track cases nationally and state by state, and select specific states to see the charts graph daily Covid-19 trends. 

I hope to include a scalable, more mobile-friendly version soon. As well as further include data to give a more rich picture of the daily spread of the virus.
